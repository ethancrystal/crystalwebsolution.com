# Changelog

Every production deploy of crystalwebsolution.com gets one entry here, newest
first. The version format and rules live in `VERSIONING.md`. The version in
the top entry of this file is always the version currently in production (or
about to be, if the PR hasn't merged yet).

## v1.06 — 2026-08-27

- Fix `cleanup_stale_project_attachments`: it was deleting rows directly
  from `storage.objects`, which Supabase blocks — this had been failing on
  nearly every `crm-notifications` cron run since 2026-08-17. Migration
  `0038` changes the RPC to only claim/delete the metadata row and return
  each `storage_path`; the cron route now removes the actual object via the
  Storage API (`supabase.storage.from('project-files').remove(...)`).
- Launch the CRM: it is now intentionally publicly reachable in Production
  (previously gated pre-launch). `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect launched
  state and the production domain change (crystalwebsolution.com →
  cdsportswearusa.com).
- UI polish pass (8 fixes, all mechanical/no design changes): import
  existing `lib/easing.js` tokens instead of duplicating raw GSAP ease
  strings (Reveal.jsx, Menu.jsx, About.jsx); add missing `:focus-visible`
  states to the nav login/burger controls and three marketing anchor types;
  add missing hover/focus states to the CRM approval buttons and workspace
  sidebar toggle; wire the unused `SkeletonDetail`/`SkeletonTable`
  components into 11 CRM pages that previously showed bare "Loading..."
  text; remove dead `.crm-loading` CSS left behind in 5 pages that already
  migrated to `SkeletonTable`; fix `app/admin/projects` showing "no results
  match filters" even with zero filters applied; strip inert Tailwind
  utility classes from `MagnifiedBento.jsx` (this project has no Tailwind
  build).

## v1.05 — 2026-08-27

- Fix `useUserRole()` reading `user.app_metadata.role`, a claim this app
  never sets — `isAdmin`/`isPm` were always `false`, silently redirecting
  real admins off `/admin/users` and hiding admin-only controls on the
  companies/contacts/deals pages. It now reads `role` from the `profiles`
  table, matching `middleware.js`.
- Add a `requireRole()` backstop to the three portal layouts
  (`app/admin`, `app/dashboard`, `app/team`), which were bare
  pass-throughs relying entirely on middleware. Allowed roles mirror
  `lib/auth/roles.mjs`'s existing portal mapping exactly.
- Wire the 8 existing `tests/marketing/*.test.jsx` vitest tests into a
  new `pnpm test:marketing` script and the `docker-ci.yml` test job —
  they had a working `vitest.config.js` but nothing ever ran them.
- Fix `docker-ci.yml`'s CI test gate itself: it pinned Node 20, but
  `pnpm@11.21.0` (this repo's pinned package manager) requires Node
  >=22.13 and crashes immediately on Node 20 with
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE: node:sqlite` — the gate v1.04 just added
  has been failing on every PR since it merged, for this reason alone,
  regardless of the PR's actual content. Bumped to Node 24, matching
  local dev.

## v1.04 — 2026-08-27

- Add a CI test gate: `docker-ci.yml` now runs `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`
  before the Docker image build, and the image build depends on that job
  succeeding — previously nothing blocked a failing test suite from merging
  to `main`.
- Consolidate `docker-ci.yml` and `docker-publish.yml` into one workflow
  (kept cosign image signing) and fix the missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build args
  on the published `ghcr.io` image, so `docker run` per `README.md` produces
  a working image once the corresponding repo Variables are set.
- Add Upstash Redis-backed rate limiting (`lib/rateLimit.mjs`) to
  `POST /api/contact` and the `signUp`/`resendConfirmationEmail`/
  `requestPasswordReset` auth actions, implementing ADR-002 as Option C.
  Fails open until `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are
  configured.
- Reconcile the migration ledger against the live database read-only via the
  Supabase MCP connection: of the previously-undifferentiated `0025`-`0034`
  range, only `0031` and `0032` are genuinely unapplied (see
  `docs/reports/migration-ledger-reconciliation-2026-08-27.md`); no `db push`
  was run.

## v1.03 — 2026-08-27

- Remove `flake.nix`, `shell.nix`, and `.envrc` — the Nix dev-environment
  shims were unreferenced by docs, CI, or tooling and added no value over
  the existing pnpm/Node workflow.

## v1.02 — 2026-08-26

- Add `council.yaml` and `council/prompts/` — configures the Agent Council
  (5-deliberator quality gate) for this repo's prose docs (`docs/`,
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSIONING.md`).
  Scoped to docs, not source code — the council reviews text artifacts, not
  application code. `runtime.type: claude_cli` shells out to a separate,
  metered `claude` CLI process; `validate-config`/`health` are free,
  `review`/`sweep` are not.

## v1.01 — 2026-08-20

- Adopt the release versioning convention: `VERSION` file, this changelog,
  `VERSIONING.md`, and mandatory rules for all agents in `CLAUDE.md` /
  `AGENTS.md`. First named production deploy.
