# Changelog

Every production deploy of crystalwebsolution.com gets one entry here, newest
first. The version format and rules live in `VERSIONING.md`. The version in
the top entry of this file is always the version currently in production (or
about to be, if the PR hasn't merged yet).

## v1.02 — 2026-08-26

- Add `council.yaml` and `council/prompts/` — configures the Agent Council
  (5-deliberator quality gate) for this repo's prose docs (`docs/`,
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSIONING.md`).
  Scoped to docs, not source code — the council reviews text artifacts, not
  application code. `runtime.type: claude_cli` shells out to a separate,
  metered `claude` CLI process; `validate-config`/`health` are free,
  `review`/`sweep` are not.

## v1.01 — 2026-08-20

- Adopt the release versioning convention: `VERSION` file, this changelog,
  `VERSIONING.md`, and mandatory rules for all agents in `CLAUDE.md` /
  `AGENTS.md`. First named production deploy.
